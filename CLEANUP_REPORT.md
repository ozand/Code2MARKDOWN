# Dependency Cleanup Report - v1.1.1

## Summary
Successfully cleaned up Code2MARKDOWN project dependencies and optimized the development environment.

## Actions Performed

### 1. File Removal
- ❌ **Removed `requirements_minimal.txt`** - Duplicate of requirements.txt (5 packages)
- ❌ **Removed `requirements_new.txt`** - System-wide dump (362 packages)
- ✅ **Kept `requirements.txt`** - Core dependencies only (5 packages)

### 2. Virtual Environment
- 🔄 **Rebuilt `.venv`** - Fresh virtual environment
- ✅ **Verified installation** - All dependencies work correctly
- 📦 **Package count**: Reduced from 362 to 45 total packages (including sub-dependencies)

### 3. Dependency Verification
All 5 packages in `requirements.txt` are actually used in the code:

| Package | Version | Usage in Code |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `streamlit` | >=1.38.0 | Main UI framework |
| `pybars3` | >=0.9.7 | Handlebars template compilation |
| `pathspec` | >=0.12.1 | File filtering (.gitignore patterns) |
| `pyperclip` | >=1.9.0 | Clipboard operations |
| `pandas` | >=2.2.3 | Data handling and processing |

### 4. Testing
- ✅ **Import test passed** - All core functions importable
- ✅ **Setup script works** - `setup.bat` installs correctly
- ✅ **Application starts** - No missing dependencies

### 5. Documentation
- 📝 **Updated CHANGELOG.md** - Added v1.1.1 entry
- 🏷️ **Created git tag** - v1.1.1 with detailed description
- 🔄 **Pushed to GitHub** - All changes synchronized

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner development environment** - No unnecessary packages
2. **Faster installation** - Fewer dependencies to download
3. **Reduced attack surface** - Less third-party code
4. **Better maintainability** - Clear dependency requirements
5. **Smaller virtual environment** - Disk space optimization

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check current dependencies
pip list | wc -l  # Should show ~45 packages

# Test core functionality
python -c "from app import convert_to_xml, prepare_file_content; print('✅ OK')"

# Run setup
.\setup.bat  # Should complete without errors
```

## Next Steps
- Dependencies are now optimized and verified
- Project is ready for future development
- No additional cleanup required
