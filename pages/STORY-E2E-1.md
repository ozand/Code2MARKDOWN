# Implement E2E Testing Framework and Tools

## User Story
As a developer working on the Code2Markdown project, I want a properly configured E2E testing framework with Pytest and Playwright, so that I can write and run reliable end-to-end tests for critical user workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Requirements
1. **Framework Installation**: Install and configure E2E testing tools:
   - Add pytest and pytest-playwright as development dependencies using `uv add --dev`
   - Install Playwright browser binaries using `uv run playwright install`
   - Configure Pytest for E2E testing with appropriate settings
   - Ensure all tools are compatible with the project's Python version

2. **Test Environment Setup**: Create a dedicated E2E testing environment:
   - Establish a separate test environment for E2E tests
   - Configure environment variables for test settings
   - Set up test data management for isolated test execution
   - Ensure the test environment is reproducible and consistent

3. **Basic Test Structure**: Create the foundational structure for E2E tests:
   - Set up the basic directory structure for E2E tests
   - Create a simple example test to verify the setup works
   - Configure test execution settings and options
   - Ensure tests can be run locally with a single command

### Quality Requirements
1. **Configuration Management**: Ensure all configurations are:
   - Stored in version control for reproducibility
   - Documented with clear explanations of settings
   - Organized in a logical and maintainable structure
   - Flexible enough to support different testing scenarios

2. **Execution Efficiency**: Optimize the test execution process:
   - Configure parallel test execution where possible
   - Set up test isolation to prevent interference between tests
   - Implement appropriate timeouts for test operations
   - Ensure test execution is reliable and consistent

3. **Integration with Development Workflow**: Ensure E2E tests integrate well with:
   - The existing development environment and tools
   - The project's dependency management system
   - The overall testing strategy and approach
   - The team's development practices and processes

## Technical Notes
- Follow the guidelines from [[rules.03-e2e-tests-guidline]] for E2E testing
- Use the existing [[tests/e2e/|`tests/e2e/`]] directory for E2E tests
- Consider using environment variables for configuration
- Ensure the setup works across different development environments
- Document the installation and setup process for team members
- Consider how the E2E tests will interact with the application

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Pytest and Playwright are installed as development dependencies
- [ ] Playwright browser binaries are installed and configured
- [ ] E2E test configuration is set up and documented
- [ ] Basic test structure is created and working
- [ ] Tests can be executed with a single command
- [ ] Test environment is properly configured and isolated
- [ ] Installation and setup documentation is complete
- [ ] Team members can successfully run the example test
- [ ] Configuration is stored in version control
- [ ] Integration with existing development workflow is verified
