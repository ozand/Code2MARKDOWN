# Implement Test Data Management for E2E Tests

## User Story
As a developer working on the Code2Markdown project, I want a robust test data management system for E2E tests, so that tests are independent, maintainable, and can create and clean up their own data reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Requirements
1. **Test Data Structure**: Create a proper structure for managing test data:
   - Organize test data files in a logical hierarchy within [[tests/e2e/data/|`tests/e2e/data/`]]
   - Implement data fixtures for different test scenarios
   - Create data templates for common test objects
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions for all test data files

2. **Data Isolation**: Ensure complete data isolation between tests:
   - Implement mechanisms for creating unique test data for each test
   - Develop cleanup procedures to remove test data after test execution
   - Prevent data leakage between tests that could cause flaky behavior
   - Support both in-memory and persistent data storage scenarios

3. **Data Factory Implementation**: Develop a data factory pattern for test data creation:
   - Create factory classes for generating test data objects
   - Implement methods for creating valid and invalid test data variants
   - Support relationships between different data objects
   - Provide easy-to-use interfaces for data creation in tests

### Quality Requirements
1. **Data Management Best Practices**: Follow established test data management practices:
   - Avoid hardcoded test data values in test files
   - Use meaningful and realistic test data that reflects actual usage
   - Implement data validation to ensure test data integrity
   - Document the test data structure and usage patterns

2. **Performance and Scalability**: Ensure the test data system supports efficient test execution:
   - Optimize data creation and cleanup operations for performance
   - Minimize the overhead of test data management on test execution time
   - Support parallel test execution without data conflicts
   - Implement efficient data seeding strategies for large test datasets

3. **Maintainability**: Design the test data system for long-term maintainability:
   - Make it easy to add new test data types and templates
   - Implement clear separation between test data definition and test logic
   - Create utilities for common data manipulation operations
   - Document how to extend and maintain the test data system

## Technical Notes
- Follow the guidelines from [[rules.03-e2e-tests-guidline]] for data isolation
- Consider using pytest fixtures for managing test data lifecycle
- Implement support for different test environments (development, staging, etc.)
- Ensure test data works well with the Page Object Model structure
- Consider how to handle sensitive data in test scenarios
- Document the test data management approach for the team
