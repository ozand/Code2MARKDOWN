# Implement Maintenance and Debugging Tools for E2E Tests

## User Story
As a developer working on the Code2Markdown project, I want comprehensive maintenance and debugging tools for E2E tests, so that I can efficiently diagnose test failures, manage flaky tests, and maintain the long-term health of the test suite.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Requirements
1. **Trace Viewer Integration**: Implement Playwright Trace Viewer integration for debugging:
   - Configure trace collection during test execution
   - Create scripts to view and analyze trace files
   - Integrate trace viewing with the CI/CD artifact collection
   - Document how to use the Trace Viewer for effective debugging

2. **Flaky Test Management**: Develop a comprehensive system for managing flaky tests:
   - Implement detection mechanisms to identify flaky tests
   - Create a process for isolating and investigating flaky behavior
   - Develop strategies for fixing or removing problematic tests
   - Establish metrics for tracking flaky test trends over time

3. **Test Maintenance Tools**: Create tools for ongoing test maintenance:
   - Implement scripts for updating Page Objects when the UI changes
   - Develop utilities for identifying and removing obsolete tests
   - Create tools for batch updating test data and locators
   - Implement test performance monitoring and optimization tools

### Quality Requirements
1. **Debugging Efficiency**: Ensure the debugging tools significantly improve debugging efficiency:
   - Minimize the time needed to diagnose and fix test failures
   - Provide clear and actionable insights from trace analysis
   - Support both local and remote debugging scenarios
   - Integrate with existing development tools and workflows

2. **Proactive Maintenance**: Design tools that support proactive test maintenance:
   - Identify potential issues before they cause test failures
   - Provide recommendations for test improvements
   - Support automated refactoring of test code
   - Enable continuous improvement of test quality and reliability

3. **Documentation and Training**: Ensure comprehensive documentation and training:
   - Create detailed documentation for all maintenance and debugging tools
   - Develop training materials for team members
   - Establish best practices for test maintenance and debugging
   - Provide examples of common debugging scenarios and solutions

## Technical Notes
- Follow the guidelines from [[rules.03-e2e-tests-guidline]] for maintenance and debugging
- Consider integrating with existing development and debugging tools
- Implement proper error handling and logging in all tools
- Ensure compatibility with the existing test infrastructure
- Consider how to handle sensitive data in debugging contexts
- Document the maintenance and debugging workflow for the team
