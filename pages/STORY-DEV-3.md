# STORY-DEV-3: Implement User Registration API

## User Story
As a new user, I want to be able to register for an account so that I can access the system's features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- API endpoint `/api/register` accepts POST requests with user data
- Validates required fields: username, email, password
- Creates new user record in database
- Returns JSON response with success message or validation errors
- Handles duplicate username/email gracefully
- Passwords are securely hashed before storage

## Technical Notes
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- Implement input validation middleware
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Add appropriate error handling and logging

## Definition of Done
- Code is implemented and tested
- API documentation is updated
- Unit tests cover validation logic
- Integration tests verify database operations
- Code passes all quality checks
