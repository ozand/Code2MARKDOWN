# Implement CI/CD Integration for E2E Tests

## User Story
As a developer working on the Code2Markdown project, I want a robust CI/CD integration for E2E tests, so that tests run automatically in the appropriate pipeline stage and provide actionable feedback when they fail.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Requirements
1. **CI Pipeline Integration**: Integrate E2E tests into the CI/CD pipeline:
   - Configure E2E tests to run in a dedicated stage after application deployment
   - Ensure tests run against the correct environment (staging/preview)
   - Implement proper environment configuration for test execution
   - Support both scheduled and trigger-based test execution

2. **Artifact Collection**: Implement comprehensive artifact collection on test failures:
   - Configure automatic capture of Playwright traces on test failures
   - Collect screenshots at the point of failure
   - Record videos of test execution for debugging
   - Store artifacts in an accessible location with proper retention policies

3. **Test Reporting**: Develop detailed test reporting for CI/CD:
   - Generate clear and actionable test reports
   - Include test execution time and performance metrics
   - Highlight flaky tests that show inconsistent behavior
   - Provide links to all collected artifacts in the test report

### Quality Requirements
1. **Reliability**: Ensure the CI/CD integration is reliable and stable:
   - Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Handle environment setup and teardown gracefully
   - Minimize false positives and false negatives in test results
   - Ensure consistent behavior across different pipeline runs

2. **Performance**: Optimize the CI/CD integration for performance:
   - Implement parallel test execution where possible
   - Minimize the overall pipeline execution time
   - Optimize environment setup and teardown processes
   - Balance between comprehensive testing and pipeline speed

3. **Maintainability**: Design the CI/CD integration for long-term maintainability:
   - Create clear documentation for the CI/CD configuration
   - Make it easy to update and modify the pipeline configuration
   - Implement proper versioning for CI/CD configuration files
   - Provide guidance for debugging common CI/CD issues

## Technical Notes
- Follow the guidelines from [[rules.03-e2e-tests-guidline]] for CI/CD integration
- Consider using GitHub Actions or the existing CI/CD platform
- Implement proper environment variable management for different stages
- Ensure compatibility with the existing test configuration and dependencies
- Consider how to handle secrets and sensitive data in the CI/CD pipeline
- Document the CI/CD setup process for the team
