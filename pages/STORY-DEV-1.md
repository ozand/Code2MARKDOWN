# Development Scripts Documentation Enhancement

## User Story
As a developer working on the Code2Markdown project, I want comprehensive documentation for all development scripts in the `scripts/development/` directory, so that I can understand their purpose, usage, and interfaces without having to read the source code.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Requirements
1. **README Creation**: A comprehensive [`README.md`](scripts/development/README.md) file must be created in the `scripts/development/` directory
2. **Script Documentation**: Each existing script must have proper module-level docstrings that explain:
   - Purpose and functionality
   - Command-line interface (CLI flags and parameters)
   - Usage examples
   - Expected inputs and outputs
3. **Interface Documentation**: All CLI arguments must be clearly documented with descriptions, types, and default values
4. **Usage Examples**: Provide practical examples of how to run each script with different parameter combinations

### Documentation Structure Requirements
1. **Main README Structure**:
   - Overview of the `scripts/development/` directory purpose
   - Table of contents with links to individual script documentation
   - Quick start guide for new developers
   - Common usage patterns and workflows
   - Troubleshooting section

2. **Individual Script Documentation**:
   - Clear, concise description of purpose
   - Complete parameter reference
   - Return codes and error handling
   - Dependencies and requirements
   - Integration with other scripts

### Quality Standards
1. **Consistency**: All documentation must follow the same format and style
2. **Completeness**: No script should be undocumented
3. **Accuracy**: Documentation must match the actual script behavior
4. **Maintainability**: Documentation should be easy to update when scripts change

## Technical Notes
- Follow the guidelines from [`rules.02-scripts-structure`](rules.02-scripts-structure.md) for script documentation standards
- Use clear, technical language appropriate for developers
- Include examples that can be copied and pasted
- Consider adding diagrams or flowcharts for complex workflows

## Definition of Done
- [ ] [`scripts/development/README.md`](scripts/development/README.md) exists and is comprehensive
- [ ] All existing scripts have proper module-level docstrings
- [ ] CLI interfaces are fully documented
- [ ] Usage examples are provided for each script
- [ ] Documentation has been reviewed for accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Documentation follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Links to related documentation are properly cross-referenced
