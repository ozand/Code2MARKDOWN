# Implement Page Object Model (POM) Structure

## User Story
As a developer working on the Code2Markdown project, I want a well-structured Page Object Model (POM) for E2E tests, so that tests are maintainable, readable, and less prone to breaking when the UI changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Requirements
1. **POM Directory Structure**: Create a proper directory structure for Page Objects:
   - Organize Page Objects in a logical hierarchy within [[tests/e2e/pages/|`tests/e2e/pages/`]]
   - Create base page classes with common functionality
   - Implement specific page classes for each major application view
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions for all Page Objects

2. **Page Object Implementation**: Develop robust Page Object classes:
   - Create page classes that encapsulate UI interactions for each page
   - Implement methods for all user actions on each page
   - Use appropriate locators (prioritizing user-facing attributes and data-testid)
   - Include proper error handling and waiting mechanisms

3. **Test Refactoring**: Refactor existing tests to use the POM structure:
   - Update existing tests to use Page Objects instead of direct Playwright calls
   - Ensure tests are more readable and focused on user behavior
   - Eliminate code duplication between tests
   - Verify that all tests still pass after refactoring

### Quality Requirements
1. **Locator Strategy**: Implement a consistent and robust approach to element locators:
   - Prioritize user-facing attributes (roles, text, labels)
   - Use data-testid attributes for elements without clear user-facing attributes
   - Avoid brittle selectors like auto-generated CSS classes or complex XPath
   - Document the locator strategy for the team

2. **Maintainability**: Ensure the POM structure supports long-term maintainability:
   - Design Page Objects to be easily extensible for new features
   - Implement clear separation between page interaction and test logic
   - Create utilities for common operations across pages
   - Document how to create and modify Page Objects

3. **Best Practices**: Follow established POM best practices:
   - Keep Page Objects focused on a single page or component
   - Return new Page Objects when navigating to different pages
   - Use meaningful method names that describe user actions
   - Implement appropriate waiting strategies for dynamic content

## Technical Notes
- Follow the guidelines from [[rules.03-e2e-tests-guidline]] for Page Object Model
- Use Playwright's built-in auto-waiting mechanisms instead of hardcoded waits
- Consider creating a base page class with common functionality
- Document the POM structure and how to use it
- Ensure Page Objects work well with the existing test configuration
- Consider how to handle common UI elements that appear on multiple pages

## Definition of Done
- [ ] POM directory structure is created and organized
- [ ] Base page class with common functionality is implemented

- [ ] All tests pass after refactoring
- [ ] Documentation explains how to create and use Page Objects
- [ ] Team members understand the POM structure and approach
- [ ] POM structure supports future application changes
