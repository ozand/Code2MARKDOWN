# Dead Code Cleanup Report

This report documents the dead code cleanup performed on the code2markdown project according to the quality guidelines specified in `.roo/rules/01-quality-guideline.md`, section 6.

## Changes Made

### 1. Unused Variable Removal

**File**: `test_service_debug.py`

**Issue**: The variable `template_content` was defined but never used, causing a F841 error when running Ruff checks.

**Fix**: Removed the unused variable definition on line 51:
```python
# Removed this line:
template_content = "# Project: {{ absolute_code_path }}\n\n{{ source_tree }}\n\n{{#each files}}\n{{path}}:\n```\n{{code}}\n```\n{{/each}}"
```

### 2. Deprecated Script Archiving

Several deprecated scripts were identified and moved to the `scripts/development/archive/` directory to maintain a clean development environment:

#### Archived Scripts

1. **`scripts/development/fix_escaped_chars.py`**
   - Deprecated in favor of `fix_escaped_chars_v2.py`
   - Both scripts were created on the same date, but v2 is the improved version
   - Moved to `scripts/development/archive/fix_escaped_chars.py`

2. **`scripts/development/check_circular_imports.py`**
   - Deprecated in favor of `analyze_architecture.py`
   - Both scripts performed the same function (checking for circular imports)
   - `analyze_architecture.py` is a more extensible solution that can be expanded for other architectural checks
   - Moved to `scripts/development/archive/check_circular_imports.py`

### 3. Documentation Updates

The `scripts/development/README.md` file was updated to reflect the current scripts in use:

- Removed references to the archived scripts
- Updated descriptions to accurately reflect the current functionality
- Maintained clear documentation for the active development scripts

## Summary

The cleanup process successfully:

1. ✅ Removed unused variables that were causing code quality issues
2. ✅ Archived deprecated scripts to maintain a clean development environment
3. ✅ Updated documentation to reflect the current state of the codebase

These changes improve code maintainability and reduce clutter in the development scripts directory, aligning with the project's quality guidelines.
